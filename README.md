## Inspiration

This is day 9 of the '50 Projects In 50 Days' Udemy course by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.
I have chosen this course to practise and solidify my existing HTML, CSS & JavaScript knowledge and to gain a broader understanding of how they all work together to produce the features of websites, plus hopefully learn a few tips and tricks along the way.
